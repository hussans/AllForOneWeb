**Project Name**: All For One - Build

**Description**: Develop an 11-page application with a home page linking to 10 mini API endpoint challenge pages, each dedicated to a specific functionality: Say Hello, Adding, Asking Questions, Greater or Less, Madlib, Odd or Even, ReverseIt (alphanumeric), ReverseIt (numbers only), Magic 8 Ball, and Restaurant Picker. Each page will feature user input fields to collect relevant data and display the backend API response clearly. For example, the Restaurant Picker page will allow users to input a category and display a random restaurant suggestion fetched from the API.

**Review**:
I like the color choices you made, I also like the icons you used to represent the different games.HelloWord wasnt working on the frontend. Responsiveness is there also. Good job!
